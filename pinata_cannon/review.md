Package name adheres to module / package naming standards (lowercase, seperated by underscores)

Imports are encouraged to be alphabetical by PEP8 standards, quick fix        -----------------

Code is mostly consistent having 2 lines between top level functions and classes.

All comments conform to having a space in between the crosshatch and the beginning of the comment.

No docstrings for functions or classes                                        -----------------

All functions and classes follow encouraged naming formats.

All code appears to conform to 80 character horizontal limit.

Overall, Cortez's code conforms to PEP 8 standards.  The most notable instances of non-conformity
are the absence of docstrings for all functions and classes, and the order in which libraries
were imported (should be alphabetical).  Cortez's code is above my skill limit at the moment, but 
it was structured in a way that made it visually understandable.
